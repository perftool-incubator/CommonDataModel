# This script will query *all* runs and try to output the primary-metric
# for each of the benchmark iteration/samples.  It will also attempt
# to find any tools and list the metric_source (like sar), and for each
# metric_source, list the metric_types (like L2-Gbps).  Uncomment the
# "node get-metric-data ..." lines to output a specific tool metric

# This script assumes Elasticsearch is installed on the same host
